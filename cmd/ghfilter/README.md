# ghfilter

`ghfilter` is intended to run inside a [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions),
it currently only supports `issue_comments` event.

comment parsing, permission checking, prombench label

It reads `/github/workflow/event.json` and

# adding new comment matches


maybe I should convert this into a action that creates /github/home/COMMENTARGS/ARG1 /github/home/COMMENTARGS/ARG2 .....
space separated

then we can use then accordingly
